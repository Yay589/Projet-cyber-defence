Hello guys  
This will create  the dvwa container with the ssh enabled
In this  folder just  type 
docker-compose build  //  Create the image from the dockerfile
docker-compose up -d  //  Creates the container and stats it 
!!!!!!!!!!! Attention !!!!!!!!!!!
The ssh probably  will not work because the  ssh service inside the  docker container has not started 
A solution to  this  is to start it manually  
How to do this  ? 
1/ exec into the container
docker exec -it container_id /bin/bash 
2/ system ssh start 
3/ quit 
4/ try to ssh the container from your local machine  
ssh root@localhost  -p 2223   # NB: the  port  2223 can be in use in  your  laptop  so u will have to use another port rather(2224 for ex and do not forget to change it in the docker-compoe.yaml)
