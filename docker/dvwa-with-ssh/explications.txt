Hello guys  
This will create  the dvwa container with the ssh enabled
In this  folder just  type 
docker-compose build  //  Create the image from the dockerfile
docker-compose up -d  //  Creates the container and stats it 
!!!!!!!!!!! Achtung !!!!!!!!!!!
The ssh probably  may not work because the  ssh service has not started 
A solution to  this  is to start it manually  
How to do this  ? 
1/ exec into the container
docker exec -it container_id /bin/bash 
2/ service ssh start 
3/ quit 
4/ ssh root@localhost -p 2224
