Hello guys  
######### Access container with ssh #########
This will create  the dvwa container with the ssh enabled
In this  folder just  type 
docker-compose build  //  Create the image from the dockerfile
docker-compose up -d  //  Creates the container and stats it 
!!!!!!!!!!! Achtung !!!!!!!!!!!
The ssh probably  may not work because the  ssh service has not started 
A solution to  this  is to start it manually  
How to do this  ? 
1/ exec into the container
docker exec -it container_id /bin/bash 
2/ service ssh start 
3/ quit 
4/ ssh root@localhost -p 2224
####### Execute ansible  playbooks ##########
After you  make sure that u can ssh into the container with your container ip address
( You will have to customize the network section in the docker-compose file and the 
 inventory.txt to set the  ip address of ur container )
- The inventory.txt inside the  invetory folder will contain the  list of our targets (Containers) 
- The  verified_playbooks under the playbooks folder will contain some verified ansible playbooks for network  scan  
- To execute the  playbooks execute  these commands one by  one : 
# These two  playbooks  do the same  thing but coded differently
    1/  ansible-playbook -i inventory.txt ./playbooks/nmap_scan.yml
    2/  ansible-playbook -i inventory.txt ./playbooks/ports_scan.yml
# After the playbooks beeing executed correctly you will see the report files in the /tmp  directory
