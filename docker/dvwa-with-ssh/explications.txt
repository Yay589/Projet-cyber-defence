Hello guys  
This will create  the dvwa container with the ssh enabled
In this  folder just  type 
docker-compose build  //  Create the image from the dockerfile
docker-compose up -d  //  Creates the container and stats it 
!!!!!!!!!!! Attention !!!!!!!!!!!
At this  point  nothing will work because the ssh service is down  
A solution to  this  is to start it manually  
How to do this  ? 
1/ exec into the container
docker exec -it container_id /bin/bash 
2/ system ssh start 
3/ quit 
4/ try to ssh the container from your local machine  
    - There are  two methods to authenticate to ssh into the container :
        -  ssh root@localhost -p 2222  
        # This enables the  ssh through the  localhost
        # NB: the  port  2223 can be in use in  your  laptop  so u will have to use another port rather(2224 for ex and do not forget to change it in the docker-compoe.yaml)
        - ssh root@ipaddress  -p 22   #  This will ssh through  the bride ip address pool for docker
